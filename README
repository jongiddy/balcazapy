Create a Taverna workflow file (t2flow format) using a script.

Requires Python.

Create a scripted description of the workflow.  See examples directory.

Essentially, "activities" can be created and assigned to named workflow tasks.
Activities can be reused, by assigning them to multiple tasks.

Each task has inputs and outputs, which have a type (e.g. String, Number).
Lists can be represented using List(String) or List(List(Number)).

Link input and output ports using the >> operator.

On Linux, run:
setup.sh

On Windows, check values in setup.bat, then run:
setup.bat

This installed a command "balc" into the bin folder. Add the bin folder to your
PATH, copy the "balc" executable to somewhere in your PATH, or reference "balc" 
with an absolute path name.

To create a t2flow file:
$ balc myfile.py myflow.t2flow
