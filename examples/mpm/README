This example demonstrates the reusability of activities.

PlaceEffect.py and YearEffect.py are two similar workflows, but contain
differences in their inputs, and the desired naming of outputs.

YearEffect.py was created by copying PlaceEffect.py and making modifications to
the input names, text constants, and some of the links.

Some of the commonality in the workflows has been moved to other places, to
make the workflows more readable, and to ensure that future changes can be
applied to both workflows easily.

Both of the workflows eventually use the nested workflow contained in LTRE.py.
Putting nested workflows in a separate file is not only a good idea for
reusability. It generally makes the workflow files easier to unserstand.

A nested workflow file is just like a normal Balcazapy file, and can be
converted to its own t2flow file if required.  It is included as a task in the 
outer workflow using a command like:

flow.task.CalculatePlaceEffect << NestedZapyFile('LTRE.py')

Several of the common activities are contained in the standard libraries of
Balcazapy. The library contains a reusable RShell activity to format an 
RExpression as text. There is also an activity to convert a list of R 
expressions to an R list of the expressions, which is actually implemented as a 
nested workflow containing Beanshells.

There is also a workflow-specific library containing an RShell activity to read
an R matrix from a CSV file. Libraries are good for small activities that are 
commonly useful, similar to the local tools available in Taverna Workbench.

Library files must create activities. So, a workflow must be presented as a
Nested Workflow activity by wrapping it:

return NestedWorkflow(flow)

To use the library activity, import it from the library directory, using:

from util.r.file import ReadMatrixFromFile
flow.task.ReadMatrix << ReadMatrixFromFile(rserve)
